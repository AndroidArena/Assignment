# Kotlin-CvApp 
I have tried to develop a kotlin, MVVM and LiveData based Architecture to fetch the data from gist.github.com which is simple basic json object.
Tools used - 
MVVM
LiveData
Extensions
Retrofit
Coroutines

For Unit-Testing

  testImplementation "io.mockk:mockk:1.9"
  testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
  testImplementation "android.arch.core:core-testing:1.1.1"
I have tried to fetch my repository("androidarena") in the Junit Test using Mockk library.
